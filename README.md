Project Description

ObituaryMatch is a parody social media + dating platform for the dearly departed, matching spirits based on their obituary details. Whether you were “beloved father of three” or “died doing what they loved — eating cake,” ObituaryMatch finds your perfect eternal partner.
The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
The Solution (that nobody asked for)

ObituaryMatch reads through obituary records, creates spooky profiles, and suggests compatible spirits for friendship, romance, or simply haunting together.

The afterlife can be a lonely place. Ghosts have no efficient way to find companionship based on shared life stories and posthumous achievements.
